            <h2>History of a City</h2>
            <p>The name "Tangub" originates from "tangkub," a local term for rice baskets made of rattan, which the Subanen people used. According to local lore, Spanish soldiers misunderstood a Subanen couple who, when asked about the place, answered with what they were carrying, "tangkub." This misunderstanding led to the naming of the place as Tangub.</p>

            <p>Tangub was formally established as a municipality in 1929 by Governor-General Dwight Davis. It later achieved cityhood under Republic Act No. 5131 on June 17, 1967. Over the years, it has transformed into a hub for culture, history, and tourism, with its rich heritage and beautiful landscapes.</p>

            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>Strategically located near Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte provinces, Tangub is also close to Lanao del Norte across Panguil Bay. Its proximity to Maria Cristina Falls, a major hydroelectric power source in Mindanao, makes it an important landmark in the region.</p>
